1. the design is (Frontend(React + Typescript) → Backend Service (NestJs + Typescript) → Mongo DB)
2. i chose monog db beacause we deal with jsonschema and its comfortable.
3. the Frontend is inside the client folder and backend in server folder
4. i uploaded some pictures of Frontend in the pictures folders
